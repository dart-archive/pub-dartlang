<p>Part of a healthy code ecosystem is consistent conventions. When we all do the
same thing the same way, it makes it easier for us to learn our way around
each other&rsquo;s work. It also makes it easier to write tools that can automatically
do stuff for us.</p>

<p>When you build a Pub package, we have a set of conventions we encourage you to
follow. They describe how you organize the files and directories within your
package, and how to name things. You don&rsquo;t have to have every single thing
these guidelines specify. If your package doesn&rsquo;t have binaries, it doesn&rsquo;t
need a directory for them. But if it does, you&rsquo;ll make everyone&rsquo;s life easier
if you call it <code>bin</code>.</p>

<p>To give you a picture of the whole enchilada, here&rsquo;s what a complete package
(conveniently named <code>enchilada</code>) that uses every corner of these guidelines
would look like:</p>

<pre><code>enchilada/
  pubspec.yaml
  pubspec.lock *
  README.md
  LICENSE
  bin/
    enchilada
    packages/ **
  doc/
    getting_started.md
  example/
    lunch.dart
    packages/ **
  lib/
    enchilada.dart
    tortilla.dart
    src/
      beans.dart
      queso.dart
  packages/ **
  test/
    enchilada_test.dart
    tortilla_test.dart
    packages/ **
</code></pre>

<p>* The <code>pubspec.lock</code> will only be in source control if the package is an
application package.</p>

<p>** The <code>packages</code> directories will exist locally after you&rsquo;re run
<code>pub install</code>, but won&rsquo;t be checked into source control.</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The basics</h2>

<pre><code>enchilada/
  pubspec.yaml
  pubspec.lock
</code></pre>

<p>Every package will have a <a href="pubspec.html"><strong>pubspec</strong></a>, a file named
<code>pubspec.yaml</code>, in the root directory of the package. That&rsquo;s what <em>makes</em> it a
package.</p>

<div class="learn-more">
  <a href="/doc/pubspec.html">
    Learn more about pubspecs
    <i class="icon-hand-right icon-white">&nbsp;</i>
  </a>
</div>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve run <a href="pub-install.html"><code>pub install</code></a> or
<a href="pub-update.html"><code>pub update</code></a> on the package, you will also have a
<strong>lockfile</strong>, named <code>pubspec.lock</code>. If your package is an application package,
this will be checked into source control. Otherwise, it won&rsquo;t be.</p>

<pre><code>enchilada/
  packages/
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Running pub will also generate a <code>packages</code> directory. You will <em>not</em> check
this into source control, and you won&rsquo;t need to worry too much about its
contents. Consider it pub magic, but not scary magic.</p>

<pre><code>enchilada/
  README.md
</code></pre>

<p>The open source community has a few other files that commonly appear at the top
level of a project: <code>README</code>, <code>LICENSE</code>, <code>AUTHORS</code>, etc. If you use any of
those, they can go in the top level of the package too. The specific ones you
use are up to you, but please do have a README.</p>

<h2 id="public-libraries">Public libraries</h2>

<pre><code>enchilada/
  lib/
    enchilada.dart
    tortilla.dart
</code></pre>

<p>Many packages are <em>library packages</em>: they define Dart libraries that other
packages can import and use. These public Dart library files go inside a
directory called <code>lib</code>.</p>

<p>Most packages will define a single library that users can import. In that case,
its name should usually be the same as the name of the package, like
<code>enchilada.dart</code> in the example here. But you can also define other libraries
with whatever names make sense for your package.</p>

<p>When you do, users can import these libraries using the name of the package and
the library file, like so:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="dart">#<span class="k">import</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;package:enchilada/enchilada.dart&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
#<span class="k">import</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;package:enchilada/tortilla.dart&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you feel the need to organize your public libraries, you can also create
subdirectories inside <code>lib</code>. If you do that, users will specify that path when
they import it. Say you have a file hierarchy like this:</p>

<pre><code>enchilada/
  lib/
    some/
      path/
        olives.dart
</code></pre>

<p>Users will import <code>olives.dart</code> like:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="dart">#<span class="k">import</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;package:enchilada/some/path/olives.dart&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="implementation-files">Implementation files</h2>

<pre><code>enchilada/
  lib/
    src/
      beans.dart
      queso.dart
</code></pre>

<p>The libraries inside &ldquo;lib&rdquo; are publicly visible: other packages are free to
import them. But much of a package&rsquo;s code is internal implementation libraries
that should only be imported and used by the package itself. Those go inside a
subdirectory of <code>lib</code> called <code>src</code>. You can create subdirectories in there if
it helps you organize things.</p>

<p>You are free to import libraries that live in <code>lib/src</code> from within other Dart
code in the <em>same</em> package (like other libraries in <code>lib</code>, scripts in <code>bin</code>, and
tests) but you should never import from another package&rsquo;s <code>lib/src</code> directory.
Those files are not part of the package&rsquo;s public API, and they might change in
ways that could break your code.</p>

<p>When you use libraries from within your own package, even stuff in <code>src</code>, you
can (and should) still use <code>"package:"</code> to import them. This is perfectly
legit:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="dart">#<span class="k">import</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;package:enchilada/src/beans.dart&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>

<pre><code>enchilada/
  test/
    enchilada_test.dart
    tortilla_test.dart
</code></pre>

<p>Every self-respecting package should have tests. With pub, the convention is
that these go in a <code>test</code> directory (or some directory inside it if you like)
and have <code>_test</code> at the end of their file names.</p>

<p>Typically, these use the <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/unittest.html">unittest</a>
package but you can use whatever testing system that gets you excited.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<pre><code>enchilada/
  doc/
    getting_started.md
</code></pre>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got code and tests, the next piece you need to maximize your karma
is good documentation. That goes inside a directory named <code>doc</code>. We don&rsquo;t
currently have any guidelines about format or organization within that. Use
whatever markup format you like and be happy that you&rsquo;re actually writing docs.</p>

<p>This directory should <em>not</em> just contain docs generated automatically from your
source code using
<a href="http://api.dartlang.org/docs/continuous/dartdoc.html">dartdoc</a>. Since that&rsquo;s
pulled directly from the code already in the package, putting those docs in
here would be redundant. Instead, this is for tutorials, guides, and other
hand-authored documentation <em>in addition to</em> generated API references.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<pre><code>enchilada/
  example/
    lunch.dart
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, you&rsquo;re going for the brass ring. Code, tests, docs, what else
could your users want? Standalone example programs that use your package, of
course! Those go inside the <code>example</code> directory. If the examples are complex
and use multiple files, consider making a directory for each example. Otherwise,
you can place each one right inside <code>example</code>.</p>

<p>This is an important place to consider using <code>package:</code> to import files from
your own package. That ensures the example code in your package looks exactly
like code outside of your package would look.</p>

<h2 id="shell-scripts">Shell scripts</h2>

<pre><code>enchilada/
  bin/
    enchilada
</code></pre>

<p>Some packages define shell scripts, programs that can be run directly from the
command line. These can be scripts written in an actual shell language, or any
other scripting language, including Dart. The <code>pub</code> application itself is one
example: it&rsquo;s a simple shell script that invokes <code>pub.dart</code>.</p>

<p>If your package defines stuff like this, put it in a directory named <code>bin</code>.</p>

<aside class="alert alert-note">

At some point, pub will support automatically adding that directory to your
system path so that these scripts can be easily invoked.
