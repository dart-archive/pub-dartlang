<h3 id="application-package">Application Package</h3>

<p>A package that is not intended to be used as a library. Application packages may
have <a href="#dependency">dependencies</a> on other packages, but are never depended on
themselves. They are usually meant to be run directly, either on the command
line or in a browser. The opposite of an application package is a <a href="#library-package">library
package</a>.</p>

<p>Application packages should check their <a href="#lockfile">lockfiles</a> into source
control, so that everyone working on the application and every location the
application is deployed has a consistent set of dependencies. Because their
dependencies are constrained by the lockfile, application packages usually
specify <code>any</code> for their dependencies&rsquo; <a href="#version-constraint">version
constraints</a>.</p>

<h3 id="dependency">Dependency</h3>

<p>Another package that your package relies on. If your package wants to import
code from some other package, that package must be a dependency. Dependencies
are specified in your package&rsquo;s <a href="pubspec.html">pubspec</a>.</p>

<h3 id="entrypoint">Entrypoint</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Entrypoint&rdquo; is used to mean two things. In the general context of Dart, it is
a Dart library that is directly invoked by a Dart implementation. When you
reference a Dart library in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag or pass it as a command line
argument to the standalone Dart VM, that library is the entrypoint. In other
words, it&rsquo;s usually the <code>.dart</code> file that contains <code>main()</code>.</p>

<p>In the context of pub, an &ldquo;entrypoint package&rdquo; or &ldquo;root package&rdquo; is the root
of a dependency graph. It will usually be an application. When you run your app,
it&rsquo;s the entrypoint package. Every other package it depends on will not be an
entrypoint in that context.</p>

<p>A package can be an entrypoint in some contexts and not in others. Lets say your
app uses a library package A. When you run your app, A is not the entrypoint
package. However, if you go over to A and execute its unit tests, in that
context, it <em>is</em> the entrypoint since your app isn&rsquo;t involved.</p>

<h3 id="immediate-dependency">Immediate dependency</h3>

<p>A <a href="#dependency">dependency</a> that your package directly uses itself. The
dependencies you list in your pubspec are your package&rsquo;s immediate dependencies.
All other dependencies are <a href="#transitive-dependency">transitive dependencies</a>.</p>

<h3 id="library-package">Library Package</h3>

<p>A package that other packages will depend on. Library packages may have
<a href="#dependency">dependencies</a> on other packages <em>and</em> may be dependencies
themselves. They may also include scripts that will be run directly. The
opposite of a library package is an <a href="#application-package">application package</a>.</p>

<p>Library packages should not check their <a href="#lockfile">lockfile</a> into source
control, since they should support a range of dependency versions. Their
<a href="#immediate-dependency">immediate dependencies</a>&rsquo; <a href="#version-constraints">version
constraints</a> should be as wide as possible while still
ensuring that the dependencies will be compatible with the versions that were
tested against.</p>

<p>Since <a href="http://semver.org">semantic versioning</a> requires that libraries increment
their major version numbers for any backwards incompatible changes, library
packages will usually require their dependencies&rsquo; versions to be greater than or
equal to the versions that were tested and less than the next major version. So
if your library depended on the (fictional) <code>transmogrify</code> package and you
tested it at version 1.2.1, your version constraint would be <code>"&gt;=1.2.1 &lt;2.0.0"</code>.</p>

<h3 id="lockfile">Lockfile</h3>

<p>A file named <code>pubspec.lock</code> that specifies the concrete versions and other
identifying information for every immediate and transitive dependency a package
relies on.</p>

<p>Unlike the pubspec, which only lists immediate dependencies and allows version
ranges, the lock file comprehensively pins down the entire dependency graph to
specific versions of packages. A lockfile ensures that you can recreate the
exact configuration of packages used by an application.</p>

<p>The lockfile is generated automatically for you by pub when you run
<a href="pub-install.html"><code>pub install</code></a> or <a href="pub-update.html"><code>pub update</code></a>. If your
package is an application package, you will typically check this into source
control. For library packages, you usually won&rsquo;t.</p>

<h3 id="sdk-constraint">SDK Constraint</h3>

<p>The declared versions of the Dart SDK itself that a package declares that it
supports. An SDK constraint is specified using normal
<a href="#version-constraint">version constraint</a> syntax, but in a special &ldquo;environment&rdquo;
section <a href="pubspec.html#sdk-constraints">in the pubspec</a>.</p>

<h3 id="source">Source</h3>

<p>A kind of place that pub can download and install packages from. A source isn&rsquo;t
a specific place like pub.dartlang.org or some specific Git URL. Each source
describes a general procedure for accessing a package in some way. For example,
&ldquo;git&rdquo; is one source. The git source knows how to download packages given a Git
URL. There are a few different
<a href="pubspec.html#dependency-sources">supported sources</a>.</p>

<h3 id="system-cache">System cache</h3>

<p>When pub installs a remote package, it downloads it into a single
&ldquo;system cache&rdquo; directory maintained by pub. When it generates a &ldquo;packages&rdquo;
directory for a package, that only contains symlinks to the real packages in
the system cache. On Mac and Linux, this directory defaults to <code>~/.pub-cache</code>.
On Windows, it goes in <code>AppData\Roaming\Pub\Cache</code>.</p>

<p>This means you only have to download a given version of a package once and can
then reuse it in as many packages as you would like. It also means you can
delete and regenerate your &ldquo;packages&rdquo; directory without having to access the
network.</p>

<h3 id="transitive-dependency">Transitive dependency</h3>

<p>A dependency that your package indirectly uses because one of its dependencies
requires it. If your package depends on A, which in turn depends on B which
depends on C, then A is an <a href="#immediate-dependency">immediate dependency</a> and B
and C are transitive ones.</p>

<h3 id="uploader">Uploader</h3>

<p>An uploader of a package is someone who has administrative permissions
for that package. They can not only upload new versions of a package,
but also <a href="pub-uploader.html">add and remove other uploaders</a> for that
package. The uploader of a package is often, but not necessarily, the
same as the <a href="pubspec.html#authorauthors">author</a> of a package.</p>

<p>Anyone uploading a new package automatically becomes an uploader for
that package. Otherwise, to become an uploader, you need to contact an
existing uploader and ask them to add you as another uploader.</p>

<h3 id="version-constraint">Version Constraint</h3>

<p>A constraint placed on each <a href="#dependency">dependency</a> of a package that
specifies which versions of that dependency the package is expected to work
with. This can be a single version (e.g. <code>0.3.0</code>), a range of versions (e.g.
<code>"&gt;=1.2.1 &lt;2.0.0"</code>), or <code>any</code> (or just empty) to specify that any version is
allowed.</p>

<p><a href="#library-package">Library packages</a> should always specify version constraints
for all of their dependencies, but <a href="#application-package">application packages</a>
should usually allow any version of their dependencies, since they use the
<a href="#lockfile">lockfile</a> to manage their dependency versions.</p>

formatting</a> and <a href="/doc/versioning.html">the philosophy behind
Pub&rsquo;s versioning scheme</a>.</p>
